Commit changes in GitHub Desktop frequently. For example, when you've implemented a working movement script, or when you've tweaked a feature.

Remember to push and pull the repo.


## Guide to pull requests

When you want to add a new feature to the project, create a new branch and name it something related. Once you're finished with the change, open a pull request.

Somebody will review your pull request before merging it to the main branch. You cannot commit a change directly to main which is why merging is necessary. Pull requests make it safer for development.
